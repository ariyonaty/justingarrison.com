Welcome to the 123 dev newsletter!
If my [twitter](https://twitter.com/rothgar) feed is too much and my blog is too infrequent I now have a newsletter for weekly content.

I want to focus on keeping a small amount of content coming out at a regular pace.
The goal is to help you become a better developer no matter if you're a seasoned veteran or a new developer.

I also want to make you smile.
Every week I will pick my favorite gif from the past week or create something original.
