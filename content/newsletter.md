Welcome to the 123 dev newsletter!
If my [twitter](https://twitter.com/rothgar) feed is too much and my blog is too infrequent I now have a newsletter for weekly content.

I want to focus on keeping a small amount of content coming out at a regular pace.
The goal is to help you become a better developer no matter if you're a seasoned veteran or a new developer.

I also want to make you smile.
Every week I will pick my favorite gif from the past week or create something original.

If you would like to get the newsletter but hate email then you can also subscribe via RSS [here](https://buttondown.email/123dev/rss).
