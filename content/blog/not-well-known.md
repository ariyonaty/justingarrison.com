Web servers have lots of common files that are not used by humans.
Some of the most common files are [robots.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard), [favicon.ico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon), and [sitemap.xml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps) which provide different information for web crawlers and browsers.

There's a growing list of new files which are being thrown into a [`/.well-known/`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI) directory for many different applications and services.
Here are some of the more common common files with examples.

## webfinger

## security.txt

## host-meta
