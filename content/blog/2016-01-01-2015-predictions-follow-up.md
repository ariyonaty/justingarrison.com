My [predictions for last year](https://justingarrison.com/2015-predictions-5951d1ccfab2#.ou2r1378j) I was right about a lot but not always in the way I was hoping. Most of what I was right about were security and hacking still being a big part of 2015 and IE going away. Both were true although IE is only going away because of how forceful Microsoft is pushing Windows 10 and the Edge browser. Although Chrome is now the most used browser with Firefox just behind it.

I was wrong that companies would start looking at Linux as a desktop OS but I have hopes for 2016. I’ll post my 2016 predictions soon.
