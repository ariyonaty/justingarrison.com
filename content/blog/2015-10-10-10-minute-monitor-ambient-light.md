Ambient lights help with eye strain and glare from overhead lights. This is a simple light you can install in 10 minutes and should cost less than $20. There are other (more expensive) LED shelf lights you can get from IKEA but I had an old one lying around I wasn’t doing anything with.

First step is to take the shield off the light so it’s more even.

Get some key hooks and hang them on the back of your monitor.

Hang the lamp on the back
