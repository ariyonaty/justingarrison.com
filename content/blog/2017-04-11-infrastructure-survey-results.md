I recently ran a survey about infrastructure and applications for some research. I wanted to open up the results for everyone to see.

I ended up with 222 responses. Responses required logins to not allow repeat answers. I couldn't figure out how to embed the actual results so the best I could do was take screenshots of the answers. I'm not going to add any commentary around the data so you can draw your own conclusions.

The first part of the survey was focus on infrastructure.

There was a free form question that asked "What change would you make to your infrastructure as it is now?"

The answers weren't all that helpful (only 61 answers) but here are some trends I found.

11 responses to increase automation and autoscaling

8 responses about using containers

7 responses about using configuration management more

3 responses to use load balancing

3 responses to add infrastructure tests

3 responses to use Kubernetes

There were other one off answers to improve inventory, utilization, database migrations, standardization, and using more service/infrastructure providers. There were even a couple answers that said they would change nothing.

The next section of survey results focused on applications

If you want the raw data, I have all the answers in a Google sheet available here.Â [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-muIXzlKWaIaqsxpVuPflcaNzQltxr3Mc5QnLrtoU2A/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-muIXzlKWaIaqsxpVuPflcaNzQltxr3Mc5QnLrtoU2A/edit?usp=sharing)
