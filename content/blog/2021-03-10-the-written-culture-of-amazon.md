In my time at Amazon the way it uses documents has been incredibly unique.
A lot has been written about the six-pager and PR/FAQ so I'm not going focus on document formats, but I wanted to write about how our process benefits from document based meetings.

I've been wanting to write this blog post for a while and Jaana's tweet finally gave me the inspiration to document my thoughts.

My role is part of AWS container services so my experience is probably very different from other roles at Amazon.
A majority of my meetings start with reading a document.
This takes the "this meeting could have been an email" and flips it upside down.
For any product decision if there isn't a doc there isn't a meeting.

Depending on the meeting the document could be a six-pagers, a PR/FAQ, a one-pager about an idea, a narrative to help find a solution to a problem, or even a service review full of charts, graphs and bullet points.
The document adapts to fit the audience and purpose of the meeting.

Reading documents is so engrained in our culture and process that our meeting scheduling tools have checkboxes to automatically create a document for a meeting.
If I'm trying to catch up on a new service or feature launch I almost certanly will ask for a document instead of an email or even a PM to talk to.

The interesting part to me isn't in the format of the document, but how it is used.
Meetings start with reading.
Depending on the length of the document we'll read anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes.
If the meeting has a long document — six-pagers are the longest — and a lot of people then the meeting will be scheduled for enough time to read and discuss.

Reading the doc is part of the scheduled time.
I've worked plenty of places that I've tried to document everything for a meeting ahead of time, I've written well thought-out emails, I've shared links to documents, and written detailed wiki pages.
In all of my meetings outside of Amazon I had one of three outcomes:
* No one read the email/document and I had to explain everything in the meeting
* Some people read the document but forgot what it said because they read it days or hours before
* One person had a question that I could have answered via email

Before I started at Amazon these were some of the exected benefits to reading in meetings.
* All of the information for the meeting is contained in the doc
* People are not expected to find their own time to read
* The document is fresh in everyone's mind

Some other benefits I've found while putting it in practice are:
* Presenters don't have to feel nervous presenting in front of people.
* Documents help eliminate many biases — for or against — the person who wrote the doc. You read everything in your own voice and don't read a doc with a hard to understand accent, vocal ticks, or prejudices for how someone looks or acts.
* There's no "can you see my screen", background noise, or call audio disconnects while understanding the main content for the meeting.
* There's a wealth of current and past documents. Want to see what the PR/FAQ looked like for EKS or lambda? It exists... somewhere.
* You are not expected to retain document information outside of the meeting. Feedback and discussions happen during the meeting. Comments can be answered asynchronously. If more discussion is needed then the document will be revised and a new meeting will be scheduled to read and discuss it.
* If a document is provided early and I have a conflict at the begining of the meeting I can read the document ahead of time and join the meeting 10-20 minutes late without missing anything.
* Document reading from home has been a great way to get 10-20 minutse of exercise in.

There are some downsides to document based meetings.
The first I have noticed is if you're not a very good writer you will be at a disadvantage communicating your ideas.
Amazon has a lot of internal training to help you write good Amazon documents, but even with training it still requires a good foundation.
I'm very thankful for my years of practice writing for How-To Geek and _Cloud Native Infrastructure_.
Even with that background, writing my first one-pager was intimidating to have reviewed.

I've been told "if there's not a document it doesn't get done."
While this can create a more level playing field it also brings document handcuffs.
Even for small ideas, features, or iterations the first thing you will likely need is a document.
This view may be skewed from my role because while I don't build services I often have customer feedback for improvements.

The available wealth of historical documents can be enlightening to read through, but it also can be confusing to trace the lineage of a service with a plethora of documents.
I have caught myself more than once reading a document which I thought sounded similar to an existing service only to realize 20 minutes later the document _is_ for the service and I simply didn't look at the date of the document or I didn't know the product code name.

I have the benefit of working close to product and providing direct feedback about new features and services.
Many teams don't have the same goals, and document handcuffs still require them to be written.
Not all docs are interesting, but they are crucial to the decision making process.

I've said multiple times that Amazon has the foundation for a great remote-first company.
The document based process could enable employees in multiple timezones the same context as someone in Seattle.
The discussions in meetings enable faster feedback loops but limit the potential for asynchronus engagements.

I've never had the benefit of attending an Amazon meeting in person.
From what I've heard document centered meetings have been extremely successful in transitioning to remote requirements.
But the document content isn't the only thing that matters.

Amazon uses [Slack](https://slack.com/blog/news/slack-aws-drive-development-agility) for synchronus chat, [Chime](https://aws.amazon.com/chime/) for meetings, and all of the documents I read for meetings are either in [Quip](https://quip.com/) or [Amazon WorkDocs](https://aws.amazon.com/workdocs/).
That doesn't include open source work in Google Docs, hackmd, email, wiki, github, etc.
Almost none of these tools integrate together and it can be impossible to find what I'm looking for or know where to provide feedback.
With a variety of capabilities, notification settings, and intended use cases staying consistent with writing, reading, and commenting can be difficult.

Even with these identified downsides I can't think of a place I have worked that wouldn't benefit from document based meetings.
I thoroughly enjoy not having to prep for meetings, and I'm sure with more practice I will get better at writing with a more Amazonian style.
