I have mentioned the IT Crowd before and if you haven’t seen it yet you need to check out the recently released [DVD](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-IT-Crowd/dp/B000EU1OYC) or at least read some of the [1337 subtitles](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=2175768). In honor of the show my wife Beth has cross-stitched a great tribute the IT Crowd using a pattern we made from screen shots of the intro. Hope you enjoy!
