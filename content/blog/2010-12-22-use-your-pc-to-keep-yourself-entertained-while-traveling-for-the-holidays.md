## Games

If you are a gamer then you probably already have some great games stored on your laptop or mobile device to keep you entertained on a trip to Mars. But what if you are a casual gamer and don’t have an expansive library stored on your laptop?

For some flash based games you can download the .swf file to your laptop for offline playing [using the Firefox Unplug addon](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/2827/download-videos-the-easy-way-with-unplug/).
