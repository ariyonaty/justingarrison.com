I have been running [123dev newsletter](https://123dev.email) for a full year.
52 weeks in a row.
I'm really proud of myself for writing more, being consistant, and sticking to a new project for so long.

Not only did I buy a domain **and use it**, but I've received great feedback on the content and format.
It has given me an outlet to share my thoughts, and—according to the people who've reached out—added value to their lives.

The newsletter is a failure.

At least it is according to my original goals and assumptions.

I made a lot of mistakes and wasted a lot of time creating it.
I've learned a lot and want to give you the hindsight I have after consistantly writing every week for one full year and failing to meet my goals.

## It's easier to make an audience from an audience

My original goal when I started in January of 2021 was to have 2000 subscribers by the end of the year.
I knew newsletters with tens of thousands of subscribers and some had thousands of subscribers within their first month.
I had a growth hack they didn't have.
How hard could it be?

At the time I had about 7000 twitter followers and I figure I could leverage a fraction of that number to spread the word of my newsletter.
I intentionally created a format that _I thought_ would be sharable on social media.

There is a gif in each issue and if I made it really easy to share the gif I thought would help the word to spread faster than others.
Part of the reason I created the format I did was because I thought there was a possibility issues of the newsletter could go viral.
Or at least gain some momentum from readers sharing their favorite gifs, insights, and links on social media.

I spent many nights learning about open graph, twitter video cards, javascript and making it so that every post could be shared with an [embedded video with the weekly gif](https://www.justingarrison.com/this-post-is-a-twitter-video.html).
I failed a few times with different technologies and in the end it just didn't matter.

To this day I have seen **one** social media post from someone clicking the share button I thought would be a breakout success.
They only reason they clicked the share button was because I asked for someone—anyone—to share that issue.

I learned that the best way to grow your audience is from an existing audience.
Many of the people I know with tens of thousands of subscribers have been running their newsletters for 3+ years.
They have a very different format and audience and have grown it over a very long time.

Most of them are news aggregators.
Give people value by saving them time with human curation and maybe link summaries.
It's a big value proposition and one of the reasons I subscribe to so many newsletters.

But it wasn't the format or goal I had.
My goal was to teach people different aspects of what I meant to be a developer and give them some related links or tools.
Which means I needed to find an audience.

But my existing audience on Twitter was likely the wrong audience.
Some people fit but in reality I needed to find more entry level software developers or people trying to get into tech.
Until I found the right audience the newsletter content wasn't going to add value.

Even though Twitter is still the primary place I promote the newsletter I started hanging out in different audiences.

I intentionally engage with people doing #100DaysOfCode and Twitter spaces for people looking to get into tech or learn to be a developer.
Even though I don't promote the newsletter directly I still lean into the existing audiences I wasn't a part of and people in those places naturally find the newsletter.

I still could do a lot better to grow the newsletter.
I don't intentionally make the content for beginner devs but I find they're the ones searching for the content the most.
As of writing this blog post I have 326 subscribers to the newsletter and 321 followers on the Twitter account.

It's still no where near where I want it to be, but I've also learned to care less.
I still would love to have thousands of subscribers, but in reality I get a lot out of creating the newsletter too.

It has helped me to gather my thoughts on specific topics.
It's given me better habits to write weekly.
It has given me structure and restrictions that push me to communicate more clearly.

If you want to get a big subscriber base right away the easiest thing to do is to have an audience on another platform and share the newsletter there.
If you don't have a large audience anywhere then the next best thing is to go find the audience you want and start adding value there.

Find people with the audience you want and engage with them.
Add value to their posts in comments and extend who can find you by not waiting for the audience to come to you. 

## Email is personal

I'm thankful for everyone who subscribes.
Seriously, it's really cool that you get the emails over RSS or following on Twitter.

Your inbox probably gets a lot of messages.
You may be strict about what you sign up for or you may filter all my emails to the trash.
It doesn't really matter.

But I learned that a lot of people treat email different than anything else they do online.
It's not social media with frequent comments, likes, or shares.
It's not a blog posts with infinite open tabs or read later queues.

Email is different.
Many people stop multi-tasking when they read email.

They're going through messages sent to them and they do it with a mission.
The mission isn't to learn something or deeply read about a topic.
Many people put off reading extremely long emails.

I think the mindset people are in while reading emails is a big reason the share button never worked.
People don't want to post their personal emails to the world.
It's not the mindset or content they think of when reading emails.
It's personal.

It could also be that my gifs and content aren't very good.
I may never know.

But I do know that I rarely see people who share.

## Pick the right platform

When I started the newsletter I picked Buttondown as my newsletter platform.
It was simple enough to get started and powerful enough to one day automate the things I wanted to.

I still wanted to publish all the content to my own static website because that was the only way I could get the share button to work the way I wanted, but Buttondown's flexibility 

## Themes are useful
