First step is to tag a picture with #movietime in Instagram. This recipe uploads the picture to Facebook.

Next we make a text post on Facebook with a link to the picture.

Now we change our Twitter profile picture and tweet about the movie we are watching.

We also use the same Facebook post to update Tumblr.

Once the Tumblr post has been made we need to log the movie into Evernote.

We also create a calendar event for 2 hours on our Google Calendar.

And finally we turn off the WeMo light because of the Google Calendar event.
