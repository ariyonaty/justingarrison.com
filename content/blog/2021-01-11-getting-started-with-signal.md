# Welcome to Signal
You've discovered that [Signal](https://signal.org/) can provide you with secure communication from your phone that's cross platform and free!

Signal Foundation is a non-profit organization that produces the Signal App and protocols.
Their mission is

> To develop open source privacy technology that protects free expression and enables secure global communication.

The Signal app is all [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/signalapp) and their protocols are well documented and available [on their website](https://signal.org/docs/).

But that's not why you're here.
Let's show you some tips to get the most out of your new secure messaging app.

## Important settings
Signal is great but there are a few things you may want to change depending on how secure or private you want your communications.



## Chats and calls
Signal chats work similarly to traditional SMS messaging apps.
You can send text, emoji, and stickers, or attach pictures, gifs (searched from giphy), files, contacts, or locations.

You can also make audio or video calls when you select a contact.
All calls are encrypted and can optionally go through a relay server so you do not expose your IP address to the recipient.
You can enable the relay server in settings -> privacy -> communication.

A hallow check box next to a message you sent means your message was sent.
Two check marks means the message was delivered.
Once the recipient reads the message the check marks will fill in.



In the settings is also a great place to turn on screen lock which will lock signal when your phone is locked.
If you're worried about third party keyboards snooping in on your chats you can enable "incognito keyboard" to disable personalization, and change your settings for read receipts, link previews, and typing indicators.
