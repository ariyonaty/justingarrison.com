I never would have imagined I would be a part of such an amazing place. Being able to work on technology and help make cartoons kids all of the world love has been awesome.

After four and a half years it’s time to say goodbye to friends and co-workers who have taught me so much! I’m thankful for how this place has changed me and the world through our stories and art.

Keep up the great work and keep moving forward to push yourselves and your craft!

Next week I start a new adventure as a lead software engineer for the infrastructure team at Disney streaming services. It will be a great new challenge I’m looking forward to!
