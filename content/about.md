Hi, my name is Justin. I like to learn new things and help people.

- I tweet at [@rothgar](https://twitter.com/rothgar)
- I work at [Disney Streaming](http://disneystreaming.com)
- I wrote a book [Cloud Native Infrastructure](https://cnibook.info)
- I sometimes [give talks and interviews](https://github.com/rothgar/press)
- I helped make some [movies](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7463292)

### history

I previously wrote at [Medium](https://medium.com/@rothgar), [howtogeek.com](https://www.howtogeek.com/author/rothgar/), and [1n73r.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20170701000000*/1n73r.net).
I didn't bother migrating everything from those platforms here.
